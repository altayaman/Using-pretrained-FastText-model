# Using-pretrained-FastText-model

Here I have two short python code examples where I am using pretrained FastText model. 
\nThese files are:
1 - search word_vectors model (in-memory)
2 - search word_vectors model (out-of-core)

First file loads the model into memory and the second one does not, instead it just uses it out-of-core as in my case the model was about 10GB of size.
